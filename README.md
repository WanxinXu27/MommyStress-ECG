Physiological stress experienced during pregnancy has previously been demonstrated as a major factor in the development of negative health risks for both the mother and the fetus. In this
paper, we propose a mobile health (mHealth) system using a combination of accelerometer and ECG signals collected using a BioStampRC sensor on the medial chest along with micro-ecological momentary assessments (micro-EMAs) presented on an LG smartwatch and paired with an Android smartphone to develop, train, and test a stress recognition system capable of detecting moments of physiological stress in pregnant women. 

We trained and tested the performance of 7 classifiers, including a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Multilayer Neural Network. Our SVM classifier performed the best, achieving a 92.36% accuracy with an F-score of 0.9234 when using a personalized model and a 72.67% accuracy with an F-score 0f 0.7260 when trained on a generalized model. We hope that this system can be expanded to provide instantaneous,"just-in-time" interventions through the smartwatch/smartphone interface that are capable of reducing physiological stress and improving the quality of life for both the mother and the fetus.
